/**
 * --- Day 6: Tuning Trouble ---
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot
 * and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.
 *
 * As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a
 * handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most
 * important one to set up right now is the communication system.
 *
 * However, because he's heard you have significant experience dealing with
 * signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to
 * give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you'll have no problem
 * fixing it.
 *
 * As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.
 *
 * To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to
 * their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that
 * the device receives one at a time.
 *
 * To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device
 * that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol
 * being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence
 * of four characters that are all different.
 *
 * The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle
 * input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four
 * most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it
 * needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer
 * to the end of the first such four-character marker.
 *
 * For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:
 *
 * ```text
 * mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb
 * ````
 * After the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven't
 * been enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a
 * marker could occur is after the fourth character is received, making the
 * most recent four characters mjqj. Because j is repeated, this isn't a
 * marker.
 *
 * The first time a marker appears is after the seventh character arrives.
 * Once it does, the last four characters received are jpqm, which are all
 * different. In this case, your subroutine should report the value 7, because
 * the first start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been
 * processed.
 *
 * Here are a few more examples:
 *
 * - `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`: first marker after character 5
 * - `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`: first marker after character 6
 * - `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg`: first marker after character 10
 * - `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`: first marker after character 11
 *
 * *How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet
 * marker is detected?*
 *
 * @param {string} input
 * @returns {{
 *   part1: number | undefined,
 *   part2: number | undefined
 * }}
 * @example solution("mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb")
 * //=> {
 *   part1: 7,
 *   part2: 19,
 * }
 */
export function solution(input) {
  return {
    part1: findUnique(input, 4),
    part2: findUnique(input, 14),
  };
}
