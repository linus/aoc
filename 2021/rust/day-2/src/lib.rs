/// In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track al
/// third value, **aim**, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something
/// entirely different than you first thought:
///
/// - down X **increases** your aim by X units.
/// - up X **decreases** your aim by X units.
/// - forward X does two things:
///   - It increases your horizontal position by X units.
///   - It increases your depth by your aim **multiplied by** X.
///
/// Again note that since you're on a submarine, down and up do the opposite of
/// what you might expect: "down" means aiming in the positive direction.
///
/// Now, the above example does something different:
///
/// - `forward 5` adds `5` to your horizontal position, a total of `5`. Because
/// your aim is `0`, your depth does not change.
/// - `down 5` adds `5` to your aim, resulting in a value of `5`.
/// - `forward 8` adds `8` to your horizontal position, a total of `13`. Because
/// your aim is `5`, your depth increases by `8*5=40`.
/// - `up 3` decreases your aim by `3`, resulting in a value of `2`.
/// - `down 8` adds `8` to your aim, resulting in a value of `10`.
/// - `forward 2` adds `2` to your horizontal position, a total of `15`. Because
/// your aim is `10`, your depth increases by `2*10=20` to a total of `60`.
///
/// After following these new instructions, you would have a horizontal
/// position of `15` and a depth of `60`. (Multiplying these produces `900`.)
///
/// Using this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal
/// position and depth you would have after following the planned course. **What
/// do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final
/// depth?**
